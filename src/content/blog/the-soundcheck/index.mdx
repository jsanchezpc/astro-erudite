# The Soundcheck ðŸŽ¤
Thereâ€™s no spotlight yet. No roaring crowd.<br />
Just me, this keyboard, and a fire that wonâ€™t shut up.<br />

This is day one. Not of coding â€” Iâ€™ve been doing that.<br />
This is day one of showing up out loud. Of building in public.<br />
Of documenting the noise, the mess, the moments where it clicks.<br />

Some days Iâ€™ll deploy something cool.<br />
Other days, itâ€™ll just be me fighting CSS like it owes me money.<br />
But every line, every push, is a step closer to the stage I see in my head.<br />

This blog is my soundcheck.<br />
Raw. Honest. Loud when it needs to be.<br />
The real show? Itâ€™s coming. Youâ€™ll hear it.<br />

Until then â€”<br />
The Show Must Deploy.
