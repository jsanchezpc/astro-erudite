# Access to Artificial Intelligence: A New Tool or a New Inequality?
Artificial intelligence seems to be everywhere. Every day, new tools, assistants, and models emerge, promising to revolutionize the way we work, learn, and even communicate. From assistants that write code to hyper-realistic image generators, the repeated message is clear: AI is here to make our lives easier.

But while some are training their own models or using tools that automate complex tasks with a click, others can barely experiment with these technologies. And this raises an inevitable question: will artificial intelligence really be for everyone?

## The Invisible Costs of AI
Although many of these tools seem magical, behind that simple interface lies a huge consumption of resources. Models like GPT-4, Claude, or other cutting-edge systems require powerful technical infrastructures: high-end GPUs, lots of memory, fast storage... and that’s not counting access to the models themselves, which in many cases is paid, with monthly subscriptions that aren’t exactly cheap.

And what if you want to run models locally? You need a capable machine, and some knowledge of the terminal, Docker, local servers, and RAM optimization. It’s not as plug-and-play as we might like to imagine.

Moreover, most of the truly powerful models are centralized in large tech companies. Even those with free versions are often limited by quotas, speed, or capabilities. Can everyone really use AI on equal terms?

## Open Models and Communities: A Hope
Despite this somewhat bleak picture, there’s a light that shouldn’t be ignored. Alongside corporate development, entire communities are dedicated to democratizing access to artificial intelligence. Projects like Ollama, Hugging Face, LM Studio, LocalAI, or KoboldCpp allow you to run language models locally without the need for an external server connection.

These models, while not always as powerful as the most advanced ones, are good enough for everyday tasks: generating text, writing code, summarizing information, etc. They can also be optimized for modest computers. The community has done an incredible job sharing weights, interfaces, tutorials... What was once exclusive to research centers can now be on your desk if you’re willing to make the effort.

## A New Divide Between the "AI-Boosted" and Everyone Else?
This is where the debate gets more interesting. Imagine two programmers: one has access to and mastery of AI tools that generate code, document functions, test their app, and refactor their logic. The other does not. Which one do you think will work faster? Which one will get hired first?

This isn’t limited to programming. Designers who know how to use Midjourney or DALL·E can prototype faster. Writers with AI copilots produce more content in less time. And this is beginning to scale: lawyers who use AI to read contracts, doctors who use it to research treatments, teachers who integrate it into their classes...

AI can be an incredible advantage. But if it’s not distributed equitably, it could create a new form of technological exclusion. It won’t just be about knowing how to use a tool, but about having access to the power that AI gives you to multiply your capabilities. And that could make a real difference in the labor and creative worlds.

## What Can We Do to Prevent This Divide?
The answer, as it often is, lies in education and community. If we want AI to be truly accessible, we need to teach people how to use it, understand it, and adapt it. You don’t need to be an expert in machine learning to take advantage of its benefits. What you need is curiosity, a willingness to learn, and access to the right resources.

We also need to defend open knowledge spaces. Initiatives that promote open-source models, free tools, community tutorials, or technical support networks should be supported and amplified.

Additionally, we should think about new ways to distribute resources: decentralized networks, distributed computing, tech cooperatives. There are alternatives, but they require collaboration and will.

## Conclusion
Artificial intelligence has the potential to empower millions of people. But that potential isn’t automatically realized. It’s not enough for AI to simply exist. It must be accessible, understandable, and useful for everyone.

If we don’t take care of this, we could be entering an era where there’s not only a divide between those who know how to use AI and those who don’t... but between those who can use it and those who simply don’t have the means.

The future of AI is not written. It depends on decisions we make today. And if you’re reading this, you’re probably already in a good position to push that future toward a more just place.
